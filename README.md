# Redo
An undo/redo library.

Redo does not use [dynamic dispatch] which means it is <u>faster</u> than [undo] 
but less flexible.

[dynamic dispatch]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/trait-objects.html#dynamic-dispatch
[undo]: https://crates.io/crates/undo

```toml
[dependencies]
redo = "0.1.0"
```
